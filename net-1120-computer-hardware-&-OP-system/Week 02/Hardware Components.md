# Hardware Components
## Ram Types
**DIMM** - DIMM or Dual In-line Memory Module is an architecture of RAM where RAM Chips are placed in rows on both sides of the RAM Module. Most types of desktop RAM are designed in the DIMM architecture, so DDR - DDR5 is often available for lower prices. DIMM RAM will come in different pin counts depending on the design.

**SODIMM** - SODIMM or Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module is a smaller architecture of RAM modules, which are oftentimes designed for laptops and tablets. SODIMM variants of up to DDR5 RAM are available and relatively cheap. Heat dissipation is usually an issue for SODIMM RAM.

**DDR** - DDR or Double Data Rate SDRAM was a design that was born from SDRAM, being able to transfer data twice as fast as SDRAM. This also had the benefit of being able to read and write twice per clock cycle. These were 184 pins that were keyed with a single notch, and utilized 2.5V.

&nbsp;

**DDR2** - Transfers data twice as fast as SDRAM, and maintains a higher clock speed to increase read and writes. Design improved to decrease noise and crosstalk between signal wires. This design had 240 pins and utilized 1.8V.

&nbsp;

**DDR3** - Doubles clock speed of DDR2 closer to 800MHz, utilizes 1.5V, 240 pins

&nbsp;

**DDR4** - Quadruples DDR3 Storage Capacity, utilizes 1.2V with a higher clock speed of 1600MHz. Contains 288 pins and some versions are available with ECC.

&nbsp;

**DDR5** - Doubles fastest DDR4 Modules, quadruples maximum storage capacity of DDR4, utilizes 1.1V. 288 pins with different keying than DDR4 and a maximum module size of 128 GBs per stick, amazing.

&nbsp;

**GDDR** - GDDR or Graphics DDR is another form of SDRAM that is designed to handle higher bandwidth  required for graphics based applications. It is part of the DDR family of RAM, and is able to process large amounts of data but not as fast as other types. GDDR's newest version is GDDR7 as of March, 2024. Each new version increases both the Transfers/s and the Transfer Rate, with clock speeds typically increasing but not always.

**Dynamic RAM  (DRAM)** - Older version of RAM that was ubiquitous in computers through the 1990's and was used as the main memory of a computer. The drawback of DRAM is that it constantly loses it's charge and therefore needs to be pulsed with electricity to maintain the data store on the chip. This requires more complicated circuitry than SDRAM requires.

&nbsp;


**Static RAM  (SRAM)** - Required constant power to function and was typically used as cache memory. This version of RAM is much older, from around the early 1960's. The simplicity and age of this design does not mean that it is still not in use today.

&nbsp;


**SDRAM** - SDRAM or Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory, was the predecessor to the DDR RAMs created in 1963. It was low cost that was easy to manufacture and was fast for the time. The difference between the SDRAM and the DRAM was the ability to synchronize two sets of memory addresses by being synchronized to the clock of the processor, something the DRAM was unable to do. This allowed SDRAM to handle more than one data request or input at a time. This design allowed for delays of data to be cut down substantially, and therefore be faster.
