# Definitions

Spyware - Malware designed to track and spy on you, logging online activities and can log keystrokes from the keyboard.

Adware - Malware that is designed to automatically deliver advertisements to users, usually through pop-up’s or on web browsers.

Backdoor - unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication procedures to access a system. 

Ransomware -  Malware designed to hold a computer system or data within it captive until payment is received, and even then may not release the computer. 

Scareware - Malware that uses ‘scare’ tactics to trick users into taking specific actions.

Rootkit - malware designed to modify the host OS to create a backdoor, which can be taken advantage of remotely.

Virus - A type of malware that replicates itself when executed and attaches itself to other executable files.

Trojan Horse - Malware that makes its true intentions to appear legitimate. Trojans do not self-replicate as viruses do.

Worms - malware that does not require user input to replicate, and can infect host networks and other end devices. Ex. Code Red was a worm in 2001 that was able to infect over 300,000 servers in just 19 hours. 

_How do I know my system is infected?_

 -Increased CPU usage at idle
 
 -Computer freezing and crashing often

 -A decrease in web browser speed
 
 -Many more


**Methods of Infiltration**
Social Engineering - Plainly it is the manipulation of people to perform acts or divulge information, think phishing attacks as an example

Denial-of-Service - DoS attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple, sending a large amount of packets to a server or end user to cause interruptions to users, devices or applications.

Distributed DoS - This is a more sophisticated form of DoS using multiple sources of a botnet called zombies to attack. 

Botnet - a network of infected computers called bots that are connected through the internet and controlled by an individual or organization for malicious purposes. Usually used for DDoS attacks, brute-force attacks, or anything that needs mass computing power. 

On-Path Attacks - These are Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Man-in-the-Mobile (MITMO) attacks, where threat actors are able to intercept and modify communications between two devices to either collect data or to impersonate one of the devices. 

SEO Poisoning - Search Engine Optimization Poisoning is where attackers take advantage of popular terms to put malicious sites higher in rank than the legitimate websites. 

**Password Attacks**

Password Spraying- Method of ‘spraying’ the most common passwords first, such as “password123”.
 
Dictionary Attacks- Hackers systematically try every word in a dictionary or a list of common words to attempt to break a password.

Brute-force Attacks- Attack using every possible word, number, and symbol combination.

Rainbow Attacks- Using a rainbow chart of already broken hashes and passwords they connect to, they can use this before brute-force attacks to reduce time to break.

Traffic Interception- If passwords are sent over the internet in plain-text which is unencrypted, hackers can intercept these passwords. 

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) - APTs can have multi-phased plans that take place over several years. If they have network vulnerabilities, backdoors, or other resources available to them, they may wait until the most opportune time to execute their attack.
