# Hands-On Project
For my project I did the Hands-On Project 3-1, Downloading and Running the Microsoft Safety Scanner. The Installation process was incredibly easy, with very little complications. To answer question 10, which was the only question for the hands-on, this is something I would recommend to anyone. I think Windows Defender in general is reasonably good to use since it gets constantly updated for new attacks, but this method gives a very up to date executable that expires after 10 days, so it is a very relevant scan. The quick scan on my several TBs of storage took very little time. Due to the ease of the first one, I decided to go on to 3-2 as well, Configuring Microsoft Windows Security Part -1, and found it to be a beginner friendly process. Essentially, the project is just ensuring that windows defender security options are set up in a more robust manner, and very importantly up to date to watch for current attacks. It then goes on to the firewall provided by Windows Defender, which is a reasonably good software firewall for the end user. Part 3-3 further goes on with the theme of ensuring system security through updates, validating whether we have updated our Windows Updates. I’m still running Windows 10, and will not update until Microsoft fixes the error in their last update destroying peoples hard-drives and SSDs, but other than being on the last iteration of the OS, it is up to date and still receives support until next month, which is sad.

Of course I will not be sharing my firewall screen. It is unlikely that would be a huge security leak for me but it feels like not best practice to share the rules and settings set for my home network and end point devices. The Importance of keeping your system up to date on security vulnerabilities cannot be understated. Having a system established for your endpoints to be regularly updated along with carrying out consistent scans of devices is essential to all forms of security. 

Malware has affected most people who use the internet and computers, and if not directly, then companies they use and data stored on their servers certainly has been. For this assignment I will be going over the threats and vulnerabilities posed by viruses, how they enter end point devices, and what you can do to prevent them from executing in the first place.

# Viruses
Viruses are oftentimes split into two different versions, file-based vs fileless viruses. File-based Viruses are code that appends itself to the end of a file and can jump to other files in your system. Fileless however do not attach to files, making them oftentimes more flexible. They are often more able to avoid OS security because of this and can carry out their attacks. Viruses are difficult because they are able to self-replicate and hop to other files on a computer. Viruses luckily are limited in the fact that they require a user to execute them, but they can still be devious in their approach and evolve into other forms of malware attacks. Viruses can have a multitude of different impacts on a system depending on what the threat actor is trying to do. The simplest and perhaps least harmful is stealing resources from your computer for mining or other computing intensive attacks, but it can easily spread to more malicious uses in a “botnet” to even destruction of computer hardware or data depending on the level of access the attacker gains. If the threat actor gains root access to the system, a clean wipe is required, but if they are able to inject malicious code into the computer’s firmware a new motherboard is entirely necessary. This is why simple fixes, starting with learning with what to avoid and setting up systems to keep end points defended is important. Ensuring Windows Defender or whatever your anti-virus is is always up to date and scanning, and not executing programs you do not know. 

# Preventative Actions
As an intelligent user of computers, it is important to remain up to date and vigilant to new versions of attacks being used. Things like phishing links are the lowest barrier to entry for black-hat hackers but are some of the most effective with proper human engineering being used. It’s important to recognize these threats and inform others who may not be tech savvy, helping co-workers/friends/family from falling victim and losing personal information and more. Using the previously mentioned strategies of protection, as well as updated passwords to be longer and more complicated and always using Multi-Factor-Authentication will make your data and devices much more secure.
