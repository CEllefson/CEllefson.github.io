# About Me
A little bit about me! My name is Christian and I’ve been using computers since around 2002 when my parents got themselves a desktop computer and I was blown away by Windows XP (I was too young to understand what Windows XP was). I was impressed with the ability to input things with a mouse and keyboard and have it show up on the screen, but only that but the ability to send this to anyone in the world instantly. I dabbled in various classes, learning the basics of coding in C in 2016 and building a few gaming PCs with friends but never pursued more than that from a personal or professional point. I graduated high school in 2018 and enlisted in the Air Force where I was able to learn to work on aircraft as a general mechanic, and eventually travel the world! An injury during this job was the spark that brought me back to the world of computers and like that I was sucked in. I applied to college again, as someone who had been a mechanic by trade for most of their professional career had the opportunity to jump into an entirely new field with almost infinite complexity and depth, which I had loved about working on aircraft! 

I find the IT field to have so many opportunities, whether a member wants to work as a server administrator, or an IT service desk, and as a cybersecurity analyst which I would love to do! I’m deeply fascinated by how deep any topic can go and the wealth of knowledge some people who have been in the field for a while possess. It is truly amazing all the things that go into making a computer work, its ability to access the internet, what the internet is, and all the people who have come before me that have gotten us where we are today! I find it all exciting and I’m thankful for the opportunity to learn about this and make a change in my life for me and my wife!
