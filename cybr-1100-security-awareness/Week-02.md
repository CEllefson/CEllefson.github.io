## Reflection
Over the years I have encountered plenty of personal cyber risks that I have had to adapt to avoid and overcome. Through data leaks thanks to ParkMobile, I have received hundreds of spam phone calls and phishing emails pretending to be google and other companies most people use, trying to get my account password and other information. I’ve had to block hundreds of email accounts and phone numbers and even block emails starting with certain words since the people thought I was named Jake, in addition to changing passwords frequently. The risk of this all was certainly obvious, they wanted access to my email to access other accounts associated with said email, which could even be my bank account. This is certainly a risk that everyone wants to avoid and makes it very important to recognize when someone is phishing. Another phishing example actually happened to my wife when I was gone on a trip and is a surprising method. Threat actors had gained access to a trusted friends account and messaged my wife to get help to access her other accounts, which in hindsight for my wife is a red flag, but being a helpful friend helped them but in doing so gave them access to her account which they changed all emails and passwords to. It was heartbreaking for her and shows how fast you can lose access to an account, and customer support from a lot of these companies may freeze an account but it isn’t likely they will give you access back to an account once you use access, which in this case they froze the account and said there was nothing they could do. This is an example of human engineering, tricking people to give up their account access code acting as a friend.
