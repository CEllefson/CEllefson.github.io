**Reflection:**  
Week one we went over several important concepts that can be applied to every workplace. Password management and creation is crucial to any user and creating a strong password can be the difference between a secure workplace and having almost public access to your machine and network.

Phishing is an issue in any organization. Keeping all employees, especially security personnel, trained on how to recognize these emails, SMS, and other forms of contact. Being able to avoid clicking links within emails or socially engineered messages to give out private information will keep any organization working.
