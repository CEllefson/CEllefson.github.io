# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**   
This week we went over the different types of threat actors. We went over how to create a GitHub repository along with how to create GitHub Pages. Finally we went over the threats of human engineering, including phishing attacks and their variations.

**Reflection:**  
Week one we went over several important concepts that can be applied to every workplace. Password management and creation is crucial to any user and creating a strong password can be the difference between a secure workplace and having almost public access to your machine and network.

Phishing is an issue in any organization. Keeping all employees, especially security personnel, trained on how to recognize these emails, SMS, and other forms of contact. Being able to avoid clicking links within emails or socially engineered messages to give out private information will keep any organization working. 

## Summary
From module 1 we learned about the difficulty with defending systems in cybersecurity. With the age of information, all systems have become interconnected through network technologies, allowing for potential threat actors to attack personal and professional systems with the disruption to not be understated. We learned that cybersecurity is the active approach to protecting network systems and end devices, through various forms of tracking, monitoring, and active intervention. We learned about the CIA of cybersecurity, which is Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, along with the AAA which is Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. We learned about the various threat actors; script kiddies, insiders, brokers, state actors, cyberterrorists, and hacktivists. Defense of systems necessitate different strategies, some of these are least trust systems and concepts of “Defense in-depth”, minimizing attack potentials and how pervasive successful attacks can be.

## Reflection
These concepts are important to connect to your personal life and work place. Defending your personal network and end devices will protect your PII and sensitive information. Using least-privilege at home can be a difficult concept, but making sure that guests use a separate wifi channel than your private devices is a good method to increase security and privacy and protection of your main wifi channel.  Another use for defense in depth would be closing all closed ports on your end devices and adding a physical firewall device at your router.
