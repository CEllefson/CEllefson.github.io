# Who Owns your Data?

Luckily for me, there seems to be very little information about me on the internet, and what I found is very out of date. I surprisingly couldn’t find my social media even though it is out there for people to find, but they are all private so that may be a contributing factor. 

Under Ohio Revised Code 959, it is illegal to intoxicate a fish as it is animal abuse and cruelty. I didn’t know this was even a possibility In Columbus, Ohio it is illegal to sell corn flakes on Sundays which was based on the “Blue Laws” of Ohio from the early 1800’s. Most of these Blue Laws have been removed from state law, this one seems to still be here.
