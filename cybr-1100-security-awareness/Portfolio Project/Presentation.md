# Security Awareness:

* What are the types of malware that you should recognize?  
  * Worms  
    * No user activation required  
    * Self-replicates and jumps to other devices on the network  
  * Viruses  
    * File vs fileless  
    * Requires user execution  
  * Trojan attacks  
  * Ransomware  
  * Spyware  
    * Keylogger  
  * Rootkit and Backdoor tools  
  * How multiple of these attacks can be used together and spread  
* What can you do to avoid these types of attacks?  
  * This is why it’s important to never click on links on emails you're not 100% certain of.  
  * Always use MFA when available  
* Social Engineering  
  * Phishing/Smishing attacks  
  * Scareware   
  * Business Email Compromises (Think normal parts suppliers, NAPA/O’Reilly)  
  * When in doubt about the validity of an email or text message, always call the person or company directly from a number that you know is legitimate. A 1 minute inconvenience can save a much longer headache.  
  * Roughly 36% of all cyber attacks are socially engineered, so it’s important to recognize the signs  
* Password  
  * Complexity is good, but longer passwords will always be safer than short complex ones  
  * Try to make them 12-15 characters long, but of course more is better  
  * Make them complex as well, upper and lower case letters with numbers and a few special characters  
  * Never use “Password” as a password, these and variations of are often cracked instantly through rainbow charts.loading Awareness Guide.md…]()
