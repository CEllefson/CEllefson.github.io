# Top 5 Security Rules for All Users
- Always use MFA when an available option

- Make sure your passwords are 15 characters or longer, using special characters, numbers, and capitalization throughout. 

- Never click on links in your emails when you’re uncertain where they came from

- When in doubt, call them. If your bank or financial department are sending you urgent emails about your account and want you to update your account information through an email, just call your bank or financial department, if it is them have them send you another email as a precaution.

- In gmail, Microsoft has something similar, you can click a “<> Original Message” which will show you a lot of information. If the email failed the SPF, DKIM, or DMARC, it is likely a fake email. This can also show any attempts to spoof the email so it looks like an email you may consistently get emails from or send to. This is not a 100% but can give you more information if you feel uncertain about the email or message. 

# Malware Prevention Tips

As stated before,  be careful with your emails. Clicking on links within an email can take you to websites that can quickly download malware to your system, and worse can take you to the intended site, allowing you to be unaware that your system is compromised.

Always have an up to date antivirus on your computer. For Windows OS Users Windows Defender is free and is just as good as Norton or McAfee, but if you choose to get those just make sure they are up to date. CVEs come out everyday and ensuring these are up to date will help patch any vulnerabilities in your system. 

Lastly, keeping a firewall properly configured will help monitor your network traffic and patch any holes in your defense. These may help stop malicious attacks from even occurring, blocking them before they can take place. Ensure your inbound/outbound traffic rules are properly configured and unnecessary ports on your computer are closed, TELNET is a good example port to keep closed. 

This list is not exhaustive, other things like good password policies for yourself or your company, using MFA apps that have consistently changing codes (Google, Microsoft, Okta), avoiding use of removable media, and many more. In general, learning is always the best defense against attacks.
