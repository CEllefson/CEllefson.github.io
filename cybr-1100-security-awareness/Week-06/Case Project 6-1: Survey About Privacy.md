# Survey About Privacy


Using the questions that are prompted I asked my wife and some family members. Most people know about the use of location services and the potential privacy risks involved. Not too much of a surprise but no-one knew the MAID acronym, but neither did I at first. MAID to my knowledge is mobile advertising ID which is used to track your online behavior to better send ads to your devices. This goes into surveillance-based advertisers and most heard or have experienced this. Most people have had the experience of talking about something and that thing then begins to be advertised to you on Facebook or other platforms. These all have great security and privacy implications that more people need to be aware of. The legality of these things are still murky at best, and with it being a multi-billion dollar field I doubt things will change quickly, but I hope more legislation will be introduced to reduce the ability of companies to spy on you to sell your information or better provide advertisements. The consumer doesnâ€™t need to sign away their right to privacy just to access the internet or have a phone.
